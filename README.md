# Widgets Are Us

## A microservices demonstration project

It includes these 7 projects, plus an ELK stack, Zipkin, and RabbitMQ.  I'm building it from scratch and handling
everything myself.  

I've only been working on it for two weeks, but I've got most of the infrastructure running locally with docker-compose.
I'm working on setting it up on Amazon EKS. I've got an ELK stack with Zipkin on an EC2 instance running.  I've got
the four services pushed to ECR, and I'm working on getting them on EKS.  Next up, I will set up a Jenkins machine
on an EC2 instance and have full CI/CD.

I would be remiss if I didn't cite my sources.  I learned a LOT from reading these five books.
